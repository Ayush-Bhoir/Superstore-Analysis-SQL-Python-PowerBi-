📝 Description

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, MySQL, and Power BI. The raw dataset was first cleaned and prepared in Python by handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing columns to ensure data quality. The cleaned data was then analyzed in MySQL to derive meaningful insights using SQL queries. Finally, an interactive Power BI dashboard was created to present the insights visually, enabling clear data storytelling and supporting data-driven decision-making.
